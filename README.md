# VacuSim

This project includes a driver for a robot vacuum cleaner as well as a benchmarking tool, which makes it possible to gain first experiences in programming robots using ROS 2 Humble.
The scenario is an apartment that is to be cleaned.
The driver provides interfaces to actuators and sensors of the robot.
The benchmarking tool evaluates the cleaning process.
The focus is on taking the best possible route through the apartment so that the largest possible area is covered and the floor is cleaned as well as possible.
